        <p>THE MASTER, beyond former calculations</p>
        <p>where the lost manoeuvre with the age rose implying that formerly he grasped the helm of this conflagration of the concerted horizon at his feet, that readies itself;</p>
        <p>moves;</p>
        <p>and merges with the blow that grips it, as one threatens fate and the winds, the unique Number, which cannot be another Spirit, to hurl it into the storm, relinquish the cleaving there, and pass proudly;</p>
        <p>hesitates, a corpse pushed back by the arm from the secret, rather than taking sides, a hoary madman, on behalf of the waves:</p>
        <p>one overwhelms the head, flows through the submissive beard, straight shipwreck that, of the man without a vessel, empty no matter where</p>
